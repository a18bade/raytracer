Bugs:

I believe I got my reflections to work correctly, but I had a bug in my transperency that I couldnt figure out
where it shows the transparent colors on the wrong side of the sphere.

I also believe that i handled internal reflection where T "doesnt exists" in my calculateTransparentRay function.


The "other.ppm is the ppm file asscoiated with myOwnScene.txt

This is my raytracer project, I have some bugs in it. I want to implement some more features, fix these bugs and refractor my code to be cleaner
